# SentimentAnalysis-Twitter--Using-R
Create a developer account at apps.twitter.com to create an app and to get the following keys  api_key  &lt;- '' api_secret  &lt;- '' access_token  &lt;- '' access_token_secret  &lt;- ''. Using only these keys, you will be able to do Twitter Analytics. We are going to use R for the Sentiment Analysis. First we will create the .csv for further analysis. Using that .csv file we will create bar plot, which will shows the frequency of the word. We can also create the meaningful Word Cloud. After that, we will do the sentiment analysis using NRC Lexicon. You can replace nrc with other Lexicon to see the difference between them.
